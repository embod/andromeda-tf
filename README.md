# Andromeda Tensorforce

This library uses Tensorforce deep reinforcement learning models for controlling agents in the andromeda environment.

[Tensorforce](https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce) is a deep reinforcement learning library that uses tensorflow under the hood.

## Use a tensorforce model as a starting point

This model comes with no pre-trained models, so may be difficult to tune.

We're excited to see the models that you create!

# Installing

## Requirements

You will need python 3.4 or above to use this library.

You can install requirements using
```
pip3 install -r requirments.txt
```


# Running

You will need create an agent and retrieve your api key before you can use this library.
You will need to create an embod.ai account to get these.

## Creating an agent and getting your API key

This is really easy...[**Click here to get started**](https://app.embod.ai/documentation/getting-started).

## Running

```python
python run.py -p [YOUR API KEY] -a [YOUR AGENT ID]
```

Once the agent is running you can view it's progress on the andromeda view page [here](https://app.embod.ai/andromeda/view)

You can also see the other agents that it is competing against here too!
